# This script collects abbreviation statistics -- i.e. finds words which, even if 
# followed by a space, do not end a sentence. Must be therefore used on some already
# tokenized data with one sentence at a line.
#
# Usage: ./sentrain.pl [file1] [file2] > statistics
# If no file name is given on the command line, the script reads standard input.
